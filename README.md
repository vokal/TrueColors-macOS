# TrueColors

A Mac app for designers to specify colors, fonts, and metrics in a standardized format for developers to consume.

(The app will check for updates itself after initial install.)

## CyndiLauper
A Cocoa library for handling `.truecolors` files and the data contained therein.  To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby

## `.truecolors` File Format

### A Zip Archive
The extension `.truecolors` is associated with and opened/edited by TrueColors.  A `.truecolors` file is a zip archive containing:
- top-level directory (named the same as the file was when it was saved, though not necessarily the same as the file's current name as the file could be renamed after saving)
	- `fonts` subdirectory: contains all of the font files referenced in `data.json`
	- `flat-data.json`: the flattened data structure of all the colors, metrics, and fonts
	- `data.json`: the hierarchical data structure of all the colors, metrics, and fonts

### JSON Data Files

In general, the keys within a JSON object are not guaranteed to have any particular ordering.

Both `.json` files have the structure:
```json
{
  "colors" : [
    ...
  ],
  "metrics" : [
    ...
  ],
  "fonts" : [
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### Items
Each of the `colors`, `metrics`, and `fonts` arrays consists of objects with keys:
- `name`: the individual item name; may not be unique overall, but should be unique within its container
- `path` (only present in the flattened data): an array of names from the top-level container to the specific item's name; should be unique within its type (`colors`, `metrics`, `fonts`)
- `values` (only present on items that contain other items): an array of items contained by this item; container items are not present in the flattened data.

##### Colors
Color items also have:
- `rgba`: the eight-character hex representation of the color, with alpha (RRGGBBAA)

##### Metrics
Metric items also have:
- `value`: the (integer) value for the metric

##### Fonts
Font items also have:
- `font_name`: the name of the font face (e.g., `Gudea`, `Gudea-Bold`)
- `file_name`: the file name of the font file for this font (e.g., `Gudea-Regular.ttf`, `Gudea-Bold.ttf`)
- `size_path`: the path (see `path`, above) to the metric to use for the size of this font style
- `color_path`: the path (see `path`, above) to the color to use for this font style

#### Examples
